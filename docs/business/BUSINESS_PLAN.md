## Executive Summary

**Company**: HealthPulse Pro  
**Industry**: Healthcare IT / Clinical Decision Support  
**Solution**: AI-powered clinical intelligence platform for proactive patient monitoring  
**Market**: $10B+ Total Addressable Market (Clinical Decision Support Systems)  
**Stage**: Pre-Seed / Product Development  
**Ask**: $1.5M - $3M Seed Round

### The Problem

Clinicians face an insurmountable data-to-insight bottleneck. The explosion of patient-generated data from wearables, combined with traditional clinical data (vitals, labs, medications), creates a signal-to-noise problem that makes proactive, preventive care nearly impossible.

**Key Statistics**:
- 30-day hospital readmission rate: 15-20% ($26B annual cost to Medicare)
- Average physician spends 49% of time on EHR documentation

- Clinicians spend <5% of time on proactive patient monitoring

### The Solution

HealthPulse Pro transforms reactive healthcare into proactive intelligence through:

1. **Real-Time Data Integration**: Unifies wearables, EHR data, and patient-generated data
2. **AI-Powered Analysis**: Detects subtle deteriorations 6-12 hours before clinical events
3. **Evidence-Based Alerts**: Rule-based + ML-powered clinical decision support
4. **Workflow Integration**: Embedded in clinician workflows, not another dashboard
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: HIPAA-compliant, FDA clearance pathway (510(k))
